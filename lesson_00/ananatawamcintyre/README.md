# A'nanatawa McIntyre's README

## Introduction

A'nanatawa means The Cosmic Mother Has Returned. I landed here in 1995 and have dedicated almost 2 decades of my existence to serving the community of Wilmington, Delaware alongside my family. I grew up in Mollys Old Fashioned Icecream: My grandmother's 50s-60s themed ice cream parlor established in 1999. At the age of 15, I helped my mom, Abundance Child, experient with making our own "meats" and vegan cheeses, eventually turning the ice cream shop into a full fledged vegan restaurant called Drop Squad Kitchen. Inspired by the Spike Lee film, Drop Squad, our goal is to use food to heal the people of the nation and literally "drop" knowledge and health by teaching people how to make familiar favorites using only plants. By 2012, we were featured in the News Journal as Delaware's first, official vegan restuarant and, since then, we have received many accolades such as Best Vegan Soul Food restuarant in the USA by PETA, Best Healthy Fare in Best of Delaware, and been featured in BuzzFeed.

## When and how to reach me: 

1. I'm usually ready for human interaction by 9am the earliest. Any earlier, and you might meet the beast.
2. All I need is a good Seamossacino (my family's version of a Cappuccino) or fresh pressed juice in the morning to get activated. 

## Where to reach me:

In person: Catch me sitting on a rock by the river, feet in the water, watching the ducks in their habitat. I'm almost always at Drop Squad Kitchen, making food from scratch or with my family netflix and chilling it at home. 

In the digital world: If you know me personally, you'll almost always find me on Instagram @ananatawa . If you're lucky and come across one of my many accounts, you may be able to find me on Reddit, tumblr, and Youtube. To reach me professionally and urgently, shoot me an email at ananatawa@gmail.com and I'll get back to you within 24 hours.
