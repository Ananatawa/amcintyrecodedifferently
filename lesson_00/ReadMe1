##Introduction

A'nanatawa means The Cosmic Mother Has Returned. I landed here in 1995, was homeschooled for most of my life and have dedicated almost 2 decades of my existence to serving the community of Wilmington, Delaware alongside my family. My first job was in my grandmother's icecream shop, Mollys Old Fashioned Icecream: A 50s-60s themed ice cream parlor established in 1999 and, at the age of 15, I helped my mom, Abundance Child, turn the ice cream shop into a full fledged vegan restaurant called Drop Squad Kitchen. Inspired by the Spike Lee film, Drop Squad, our goal is to use food to heal the people of the nation and literally "drop" knowldedge and health by crafting familiar, comfort foods such as mac and cheese, fried chicken, and philly cheesesteaks using only plants. We make our own meats, soy free. By 2012, we were featured in the News Journal as Delaware's first, official vegan restuarant and, since then, we have been awarded accolades such as Best Vegan Soul Food restuarant in the USA by PETA, Best Healthy Fare in Best of Delaware, and been featured in BuzzFeed.
